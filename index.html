            <span class="name">What is Anime?</span>
            <span class="lorem">The term anime [a·nuh·mei] is a Japanese colloquialism used as an abbreviation for the term “animation.” Generally in Japan, the word anime (written アニメ) is synonymous with animation of any kind from anywhere. Internationally, however, anime is typically referred to as animation that is produced from Japan. The distinction between anime and cartoons is more cultural than it is technical and its origins date over 100 years ago.</span>

            <span class="lorem">Anime itself dates back over a hundred years. The first confirmed example was produced in 1917 titled Namakura Gatana with a run time of only four minutes. Over time, it has had its highs and lows facing various obstacles both within Japan and internationally. 

                This video by Screen Rant summarizes the history of anime and how it evolved from its 1917 origins to the animation styles we see today.

            <span class="name">How Anime is Made?</span>
            <span class="lorem">Anime is no different technically to the animation productions of Western culture. Which, if you know anything about, takes an incredible amount of time and work. Stories must be written, storyboarded, workshopped, taken into an animatic, voiced, and animated.

                This is a process that can take months and often years to finish. All of these projects are created from an entire studio of artists typically led by a director. This video covers the workflows from various animation studios and just how intensive it is to create animated work.</span>

            <span class="name">Anime in Western Culture</span>
            <span class="lorem">Overtime, anime has made its way into Western culture. Despite not being at the heart of mainstream entertainment, it has found such a large Western audience that Western animation productions have created shows in the same style. Shows like The Boondocks and Avatar: The Last Airbender are American made shows with Japanese anime influence.

                This brings up a popular debate: “Are American cartoons that look like anime considered anime?” While the answer to this is still debated among fans, the common consensus is that anime refers solely to Japanese produced projects. However, the line blurs as American and Japanese artists continue to collaborate on new shows and movies. </span>

Almost 40 schools in Japan have declared anime as an individual subject on its own. Anime voice acting is also huge, as Japan has around 130 voice-acting schools. In Japan, more paper is used to print manga than toilet paper.</span>
