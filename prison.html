            <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Hachimitsu Private Academy, an elite all-girls high school, opens its grandiose doors to male students for the first time in its history. The five males who enroll, however, are a merry band of perverts who are unable to communicate with girls! This cluster of misfits is composed of the foreign delinquent Shingo, the strange and sickly "Jo," the overweight "Andrei," the intelligent "Gakuto," and Kiyoshi, the most normal person of the bunch.

                Feeling troubled due to their lack of female interaction, the five boys embark on a dangerous mission to peek on several girls while they are bathing. However, owing to a series of mishaps, their operation ultimately fails, resulting in the boys' actions being exposed to the entire school.
                
                For their crimes, the boys are sentenced to one month of imprisonment by the menacing Underground Student Council. Little do the unforgiving beauties of the council know, the boys' perverted and unusual antics are just going to worsen.</p>
